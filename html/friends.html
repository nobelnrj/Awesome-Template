                    <p>My best friend who understands me from first year. I'm not sure about this but we have some kind of wavelength which is always in sync and it still exists!! If there is one thing that i would like to have till the end of my life will be her friendship. The Things that we share are beyond any kind of friendship can have in this world. Whenever I miss her I will call her but end up in teasing her. Even a minute talk with her will be full of happiness in my life. Biology teacher!!</p>

                    <p>My best friend who tought me everything from my first year. Enjoyed every trip with him. Its because of him I understood that life on earth is precious and that I should never miss even one sec of my life for someone else. Explained me the meaning of the word fun. The way he cares about his looks I hope he becomes a model one day.</p>

The one who always supported me in whatever things I do. The one who used to correct my vocabulary. Don't stop your tinder search.</p>
